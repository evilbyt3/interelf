# Interelf
This small python program is reading the bytes from an ELF file and interpreting it like ```readelf```.<br />
**NOTE:** This program was an exercise for me to understand the ELF structure better 

## Installing & Running 
Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/Volkyz/interelf.git```.
Run It: ```python interelf.py <filename>```
